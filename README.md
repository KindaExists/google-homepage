# Google Homepage Practice

This project is my attempt at making a "google homepage", applying the skills I have learnt in the past few weeks on front-end HTML5 and CSS3.


Values for elements such as color values, general size values, etc. were taken directly from the site through devtools to avoid having to strain my eyes too much. However, the specific elements and the structure used in this project was done completely by me, and as much as possible I avoided looking at how it was done in the devtools.
